### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned about different jQuery methods for DOM manipulation and what each does. For example, "clone()" creates a duplicate of the selection.
2. The animate() method is customizable and can be changed to whatever speed you want.
3. When using the hover() method you can also customize the experience. In this lesson we changed the mouse entering to have a yellow background with css and a pink background when the mouse leaves.
